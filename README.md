# Union

Union is the hyper-efficient zero-knowledge infrastructure layer for general message passing, asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. Itâ€™s based on Consensus Verification and has no dependencies on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures, or MPC. It implements IBC for compatibility with Cosmos chains and connects to EVM chains like Ethereum, Berachain (beacon-kit), Arbitrum, and more.

The upgradability of contracts on other chains, connections, token configurations, and evolution of the protocol will all be controlled by decentralized governance, aligning the priorities of Union with its users, validators, and operators.
